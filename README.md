# Invisibility-Cloak
Make yourself invisible in real-time using Python and OpenCV. This project detects a red cloak and replaces it with the background, creating a smooth invisibility effect using color detection and live video processing.
This project:
✅ Captures your background while you are away.
✅ Detects your red cloak in real-time using HSV color detection.
✅ Replaces the cloak area with the background, making you appear invisible.
✅ Uses morphological operations to reduce noise and improve cloak detection.
✅ Provides a mirror-view experience while maintaining smooth real-time performance.

Perfect for:
✨ Learning real-time video processing
✨ Practicing color detection in HSV space
✨ Fun computer vision projects to showcase in your portfolio.

Run it, wear a red cloth, and watch yourself disappear live on your webcam!
